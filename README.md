# The OpenMath SCSCP Standard

This repository contains the sources for the OpenMath SCSCP (Symbolic Computation Software
Composability Protocol) standard. All development on OpenMath SCSCP and subsequent
standards are channelled trough this repository.

## Development

We repository use the GitHub functionalities to openly and transparently develop the
OpenMath SCSCP Standard.  The main development happens on the `master` branch, features
and new versions will be carried out on various branches.

When development on the SCSCP standard resumes in earnest, we will set up automated
publishing of an editors draft on the [OpenMath web site](http://openmath.github.io) as
for the [OpenMath OMSTD](https://github.com/OpenMath/OMSTD) repository. 

## Contributing to the Standard Development 

We use the GitHub functionalities to openly and transparently develop the OpenMath Standard. 

### Issue Discussions

We use the [GitHub Issue Tracker](http://github.com/OpenMath/scscp/issues) to discuss open issues with the standard. This ensures that all concerns are dealt with properly and the current state of the discussion is documented. 

### Making a Pull Request

The best way of proposing changes to the standard development is by making a [pull request](https://gist.github.com/Chaser324/ce0505fbed06b947d962). In a nutshell 
* fork this repository to your personal namespace (using the "Fork" button on the top left [the repository page](https://github.com/OpenMath/scscp/)
* Make any changes in your local fork, test them by building locally, commit them to your fork, and make a new pull request via the "New pull request" button under the magenta bar (second from left). Make sure that you explain your proposed changes. 
* discuss (and possibly augment) the pull request from [the interface in the OpenMath/scscp repository](https://github.com/OpenMath/scscp/pulls).

## Version History
This repository was initialized from the [SCIEnce web site](http://symblic-computing.org)
in Spring 2017.
